# Raw Dog Food Calculator / Meal Prep Assistant

Making your own dog food isn't rocket science, it's just a lot of math! The goal of this app is to help dog owners quickly calculate what they need for one meal, or a month of meals.

First you need your basic options - do you want to measure your food in grams or ounces? How much food should your dog eat each day? This is calculated as a percentage of the dog's body weight. The percentage is typically determined based on how active the dog is. Puppies also need a much higher percentage. Most dogs are in the 2-3% range, 2 being less active and 3 being very active. This determines the total amount of food to feed your dog for one day, in ounces or grams, with a rough estimate of how many calories that would amount to.

Then we get into what type of raw diet you want to feed.
